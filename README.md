Welcome to my collection of beginner C projects! This repository includes simple games designed to help you learn and practice C programming. The current projects include:

Tic Tac Toe
Connect Four

Overview
Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a space with their symbol (X or O). The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

Connect Four
Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The goal is to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
